# transaction-manager
A simple python command line tool to keep track of your transactions. Intended to be used for cash transactions.

### How to add alias to command line: (MacOS)

Open the terminal and enter this command:

`vim ~/.zshrc`

You can replace `vim` with the alias of any other text editor you wish to use.

Once editing the file, insert the following line:

`alias cash="python3 /Users/yourusername/downloads/transaction-manager/transactions.py`

Note that this is the default download location but you can edit this line to suit your preferences. You can also change the alias name from `cash` to anything else you want it to be.

Save the file and restart the terminal. Entering `cash` into the terminal will start the command line script.
